# NOTE: this integration only works with Flex versions 1.3.4 and abobe
#
# Flex has a limit of 500 events per execution.  If you are generating more than
# 500 Transactions (which could errors) every 15 seconds, then you should "shard" 
# instances of this integration by running several in parallel, adding a filter
# to the payload query on each to split the volume of transactions across them.
